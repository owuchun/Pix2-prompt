Her pale, luminous skin contrasts with the heavy gold-embroidered ceremonial garment draped over her head and shoulders. Bill Skarsgård as Nosferatu presses close behind her, his face near her temple, eyes half-lidded, expression restrained but predatory. His hands rest gently yet firmly at her waist. The gold background glows softly.\n\nPanel 2 (Top Right)\nHe is beside her, leaning in to bite her neck.\nHis mouth hovers just at her throat, lips barely touching skin. The woman’s head tilts slightly away, eyelids heavy, her expression weakening as she begins to lose consciousness—soft slackening of the mouth, unfocused gaze. Subtle tension in her neck and jaw. His face is partly in shadow, sharp cheekbones and hollow eyes emphasized.\n\nPanel 3 (Bottom Left)\nThey stand side by side.\nThe man turns his head slightly toward her, studying her with cold intent. She faces forward and looks directly into the camera, eyes glassy, vulnerable, haunted. Her expression is calm but resigned. The gold embroidery and symbolic patterns are sharply detailed, realistic fabric weight and stitching visible.\n\nPanel 4 (Bottom Right)\nThis panel is an exact recreation of the reference photo.\nSame pose, same spacing, same lighting, same expressions, same wardrobe, same background texture—faithful, photorealistic reproduction with no reinterpretation.\n\n👤 CHARACTER DETAILS (CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL PANELS)\n\nMia Goth\nEthereal woman with pale luminous skin, delicate symmetrical features, expressive melancholic eyes, softly parted lips. Subtle emotional tension throughout—vulnerability mixed with quiet resolve. Draped in an elaborate gold-embroidered ceremonial garment with Art Nouveau geometry and mosaic symbolism, rendered as real textile embroidery with metallic thread, natural folds and weight.\n\nBill Skarsgård as Nosferatu\nTall, imposing, gaunt aristocratic frame. Elongated facial structure, sharp cheekbones, hollow eyes. Stillness that feels controlled and predatory.

He is wearing the same clothes, shedding noodle tears in the panel, frantically knocking on the borders of the manga panel, accompanied by large Japanese onomatopoeia like \"出られない!\" (Can't get out!), \"えええ!?\", and \"ドンドンドン\" (Knocking sound). The manga version of him is watching the real-world version of himself tear the frame in terror.\n\nEnvironment and lighting:\nThe bedroom background is soft-focused, with domestic items like bed legs and bookshelves. Natural afternoon light streams in from the side window, illuminating the edges of the torn paper and the fabric texture of Zenitsu's clothes, emphasizing the strong contrast between reality and the two-dimensional world.",

Human silhouettes are flung backward, suspended mid-air in slow-motion realism.\nLighting is physical and cinematic: blazing orange firelight rim-lighting the subjects, cold blue emergency strobes slicing through smoke, volumetric haze, flying embers, realistic shadow falloff, extreme dynamic range.\nCamera is ultra-wide and close, natural perspective distortion, shallow depth of field, sharp subject separation, no fisheye, no artificial blur.\nPhotorealistic, hyper-detailed, cinematic color grading.\nNo cartoon look. No AI artifacts. No softness.\nMood: explosive, intense, absurdly unforgettable, viral blockbuster realism.",

Nothing in the world changes — only the camera position and framing evolve.\nThe emotional tone should remain consistent throughout the set, subtly expressed through posture, gaze, and micro-expressions rather than exaggerated acting.\nBegin by observing the subject within the environment from afar, letting the surroundings dominate the frame and establish scale and mood.\nGradually move closer, allowing the subject’s full presence to emerge, then narrowing attention toward body language and facial expression.\nEnd with intimate perspectives that reveal small but meaningful details — texture, touch, or eye focus — before shifting perspective above and below the subject to suggest reflection, vulnerability, or quiet resolve.\nAcross the sequence:\nWider views should emphasize space and atmosphere\nMid-range views should emphasize posture and emotional context\nClose views should isolate feeling and detail\nPerspective shifts (low and high angles) should feel purposeful and cinematic, not decorative\nDepth of field must behave naturally: distant views remain mostly sharp, while closer frames introduce shallow focus and gentle background separation.\nThe final result should read as a cohesive 3×3 cinematic contact sheet, as if selected from a single roll of film documenting one emotional moment from multiple viewpoints.\nNo text, symbols, signage, watermarks, numbers, or graphic elements may appear anywhere in the images.\nPhotorealistic rendering, cinematic color grading, and consistent visual realism are mandatory.",

Her fingers are adorned with 5 silver rings: a skull signet, a serpent coil, a geometric cube, a band with etched runes, and a cracked obsidian stone. She wears a crimson vinyl bomber jacket (high-gloss, ribbed cuffs), collar popped, catching the backlight like liquid fire. Beneath, a sleeveless mesh top reveals a dragon tattoo creeping up her forearm. \n\nCamera & Perspective: Extreme worm's-eye view shot from inside a drainage pipe (circular, 18-inch diameter), lens positioned 6 inches above the wet ground. Forced perspective distortion makes her hand a monumental, terrifying presence—fingers elongated, knuckles massive, veins bulging. The circular frame vignettes the image, creating a keyhole peep-show effect. \n\nAction & Composition: She leans forward aggressively, weight on her right leg, left knee bent, creating a dynamic diagonal thrust through the frame. Her right hand lunges toward camera, fingers splayed, index finger extended, casting a shadow that eclipses the dice. Her face is 3/4 obscured by the sunglasses and hair; only her pierced lower lip (silver hoop) and clenched jaw are visible, exuding predatory focus. \n\nSurface & Dice: The ground is rain-slicked asphalt with iridescent oil slicks (cyan, magenta, gold). 12 translucent red casino dice (precision-edged, pips glowing like embers) are scattered in chaotic abandon—some stacked, some mid-roll. Water beads cling to them, refracting light. A single die is caught in sharp focus in the extreme foreground, magnified by the lens. \n\nLighting & Atmosphere: Dense fog backlit by a single sodium-vapor streetlight (5700K, creating a hellish orange aura). Volumetric light rays pierce the fog, haloing her jacket. Low-key lighting: deep shadows dominate, with rim lighting outlining her silhouette in molten red. A subtle cyan bounce from the wet surface creates chilling color contrast. Lens flare: anamorphic horizontal streaks and circular bokeh orbs. \n\nTechnical Specs: Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 12mm Laowa Probe Lens (f/2. 8, 1/1000s shutter), 8K resolution, ISO 6400 for grit. Deep focus from foreground die to her face. Cinematic aspect ratio: 2. 39:1 (though can be cropped to 4:5). Shot in Log-C, graded with Teal & Orange + Neon Noir LUT. \n\nPost-Processing: Chromatic aberration on high-contrast edges, film grain (Kodak 500T emulation), micro-contrast sharpening on rain droplets. Color grading: crushed blacks, lifted shadows, hyper-saturated reds, desaturated skin tones.

The main character of the image is \"{argument name=\"character\" default=\"an over-the-top chuunibyou knight\"}\", and the overall style should reference Persona 5 and street graffiti visuals, turning the character into an extremely flamboyant, extremely flat, ultra-cool anime figure.\n\nUse sharp cel-shading for the character, with hard, clean lines and crisp contours. The pose must be exaggerated and full of motion. You can use wide-angle or fisheye perspectives so that hands, weapons, or props appear extremely close to the camera, like a freeze-frame at the moment a special attack is unleashed. The expression should be highly dramatic, with confident, manic, or cold-blooded \"overacting\" intensity, rather than a calm everyday look.\n\nReject realistic volume and shading; instead, rely on large areas of pure black heavy shadows and highly saturated flat color blocks to create an extreme, high-contrast flat look. The main colors can be bright red, lemon yellow, electric blue, neon purple, etc., contrasted against large black shadow silhouettes. Add screentones, halftone dots, speed lines, and radiating lines in the shadows and background so the image feels like printed manga layered with street graffiti.\n\nThe background does not need realistic perspective space; it should be a flat visual collage stage filled with huge sans-serif English letters, torn paper effects, ink splatters, bold arrow graphics, speech bubbles, and onomatopoeia, such as exaggerated \"BOOM\", \"SLASH\", or \"WAKE UP\" graffiti sound effects. You can integrate UI elements into the scene—health bars, skill names, buttons, numbers, tooltips—floating around the main character, as if the game interface and the illustration have merged, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nKeep lighting high-contrast but not physically realistic; think in terms of graphic design areas of black/white/color rather than natural light logic. Edges between color areas on the character and background should be very sharp, without soft gradients; all colors should be clearly separated. You can add rough spray paint, smears, or hand-drawn graffiti textures in select areas to enhance the street and handmade feel.\n\nThe overall mood must be extremely dynamic, extremely chuunibyou, and extremely cool, as if the image is about to explode out of the screen, not quietly hang in a gallery. Avoid realistic oil painting styles, low-saturation vintage looks, or gentle, soft illustration styles. Do not use natural landscapes or everyday life backgrounds, and avoid soft, pastel color schemes. The image should be a vertical 2:3 high-resolution illustration, suitable as a tension-filled, maximalist pop-art manga poster.",
