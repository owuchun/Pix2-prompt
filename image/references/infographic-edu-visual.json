Fresh milk is being poured from containers and pipes operated by workers into the open top of the bottle, with a creamy, elegant texture clearly visible inside; the milk does not come from the sky and has a clear physical source. Tiny workers in bright {argument name=\"worker uniform color\" default=\"yellow\"} one-piece jumpsuits and yellow safety helmets actively operate the process: two stand on a metal scaffold above the bottle carefully pouring milk from handled containers, while others push cardboard boxes, guide products along a conveyor belt, and operate compact dairy machinery with coordinated, focused postures. In the foreground, dairy products move naturally along the conveyor line. Surrounding the platform is lush green grass with small white and yellow wildflowers. The background features a charming farm landscape with rolling green fields, a red wooden barn with white trim, a calm black-and-white cow grazing nearby, and a white windmill against gentle hills under a vivid blue sky with soft fluffy clouds. Lighting is warm, soft daylight with gentle shadows and refined highlights, creating a clean, trustworthy advertising look. Overall style is playful, richly detailed, premium commercial illustration with strong narrative composition, balanced layout, pastel color palette, deep depth of field, ultra-sharp details, cinematic miniature scale contrast—clearly an illustration, not photography, not a model display, and not enclosed in any glass dome or showcase.",

Text layout should be concise and clear, without adding any decorative backgrounds like cards, capsules, or bottom frames.\n\nMain Visual (Core Visual):\nThe visual center is a massive, tightly stacked Q-version 3D clay sphere.

For example:\nIf it includes AI/technology content, incorporate a futuristic data center building with a sense of technology.\nIf it includes gaming content, incorporate a pixel-style game castle.\nIf it includes creative/art content, incorporate a miniature art studio.\nCombination Method: All these elements (bubbles, icons, buildings) must be very tightly and harmoniously squeezed together, seamlessly forming a perfect sphere, without revealing the internal structure.\n\nBackground Design (Fixed Frame):\nBase Color: Use a high-saturation gradient background from warm orange to soft purple (referencing previous style).\n\nBackground Text: Behind the sphere, place six massive Chinese characters with splatter texture and reverse etching effects.

The tallest must appear visibly tallest, the second must be clearly shorter than the first, and the third must be clearly shorter than the second.\nAll buildings must follow accurate relative proportions: if a building is taller in real life, it must be taller in the image by the same approximate ratio. No building may be visually stretched or compressed.\nEach building should stand separately on a thin, simple ceramic base. Below each base, centered text should display:\nHeight in meters — semibold sans-serif, medium size\nYear built — lighter-weight sans-serif, smaller size, directly beneath the height text\nProvide consistent padding, spacing, leading, and kerning. Write “{argument name=\"city name title\" default=\"YOUR CITY NAME\"}” centered above the buildings, using a medium-sized sans-serif font.\nNo building top should overlap or touch the text above. Use accurate architectural proportions based on real-world references. Maintain a consistent camera angle and identical scale for each building model.\nNo forced perspective. Use straight-on orthographic-style rendering. Do not exaggerate or stylize size differences beyond proportional accuracy.\n\nUse a square 1080×1080 composition. Use a clean, neutral background.
