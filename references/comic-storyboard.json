Dust and sparks are flying.\n\nCharacter 1:\nHigh school girl with long black hair. Wearing a sailor uniform. A Japanese sword is sheathed and hanging at her waist. She looks around cautiously, adopting a low stance.\nCharacter 2:\nHigh school girl with blonde bob hair. Wearing a blazer uniform. Standing behind her companion, holding one hand ready to use her ability at any moment. Her expression is tense.\nEnemy Presence:\nBlack liquid gathers and transforms into a humanoid entity with a fibrous, thread-like texture. Its face is vague, its limbs are unnaturally long, and it crawls across the ground and walls with unnatural movements.\n\nCut 1:\nClose-up of the ground. Filled with black liquid. Flying dust and sparks\nCut 2:\nMedium shot. The humanoid anomaly, rising from the black liquid, awkwardly begins to stand up. Thread-like shadows droop, dragging on the ground.\nCut 3:\nLow-angle wide shot. Multiple anomalies appear one after another from the roads and walls, encircling the girls in a circle. The cityscape emphasizes the feeling of being surrounded.\nCut 4:\nShot over the girls' backs. In front of them is a horde of black humanoids closing in. The black-haired girl rests her hand on the sheath, and the blonde-haired girl prepares to activate her ability.\nThe composition emphasizes the tension right before the battle.",

Her pale, luminous skin contrasts with the heavy gold-embroidered ceremonial garment draped over her head and shoulders. Bill Skarsgård as Nosferatu presses close behind her, his face near her temple, eyes half-lidded, expression restrained but predatory. His hands rest gently yet firmly at her waist. The gold background glows softly.\n\nPanel 2 (Top Right)\nHe is beside her, leaning in to bite her neck.\nHis mouth hovers just at her throat, lips barely touching skin. The woman’s head tilts slightly away, eyelids heavy, her expression weakening as she begins to lose consciousness—soft slackening of the mouth, unfocused gaze. Subtle tension in her neck and jaw. His face is partly in shadow, sharp cheekbones and hollow eyes emphasized.\n\nPanel 3 (Bottom Left)\nThey stand side by side.\nThe man turns his head slightly toward her, studying her with cold intent. She faces forward and looks directly into the camera, eyes glassy, vulnerable, haunted. Her expression is calm but resigned. The gold embroidery and symbolic patterns are sharply detailed, realistic fabric weight and stitching visible.\n\nPanel 4 (Bottom Right)\nThis panel is an exact recreation of the reference photo.\nSame pose, same spacing, same lighting, same expressions, same wardrobe, same background texture—faithful, photorealistic reproduction with no reinterpretation.\n\n👤 CHARACTER DETAILS (CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL PANELS)\n\nMia Goth\nEthereal woman with pale luminous skin, delicate symmetrical features, expressive melancholic eyes, softly parted lips. Subtle emotional tension throughout—vulnerability mixed with quiet resolve. Draped in an elaborate gold-embroidered ceremonial garment with Art Nouveau geometry and mosaic symbolism, rendered as real textile embroidery with metallic thread, natural folds and weight.\n\nBill Skarsgård as Nosferatu\nTall, imposing, gaunt aristocratic frame. Elongated facial structure, sharp cheekbones, hollow eyes. Stillness that feels controlled and predatory. Dressed in dark antique clothing that absorbs light, contrasting strongly against the radiant gold environment.\n\n🌟 ENVIRONMENT & LIGHTING\n\nRichly textured, softly glowing gold interior\n\nAged gilded walls, embossed ceremonial patterns\n\nReal material depth, patina, imperfections\n\nDramatic cinematic lighting\n\nSoft diffused key light on her face\n\nWarm gold bou",

    "content": "**CORE INSTRUCTION FOR THE MODEL:**\nAnalyze the personality traits and potential conflicts of the CHARACTERS previously provided as input. You must infer how these specific individuals would interact and place them into the four scenarios below based on their likelihood to be involved in that specific type of scene (e.g., put gossips in the confessional, aggressors in the fight scene).\n\n**MANDATORY VISUAL AESTHETIC (\"Real Broadcast Look\"):**\nThe images must NOT look like staged photography. They must look like raw, unpolished TV broadcast footage.\n* **Crucial Details:** Every panel must include on-screen graphics: timestamps (e.g., \"DAY 12 | 14:32\"), camera location identifiers (e.g., \"CAM 1 - LIVING AREA\"), and a small, semi-transparent channel logo in a corner.\n* **Textures:** Expect video grain, slight lens distortion, harsh fluorescent lighting, and occasional digital compression artifacts.\n\n**GRID BREAKDOWN (2x2 Layout):**\n\n**[TOP ROW]**\n* **[PANEL 1: Top-Left] Domestic Friction (Kitchen/Living Area).** Wide-angle fixed CCTV camera shot. Harsh, unflattering overhead lighting. Based on inputs, show a tense moment of daily life—two characters with incompatible habits arguing over cleaning or food, while others sit uncomfortably in the background. The composition is messy and naturalistic.\n* **[PANEL 2: Top-Right] The Confessional Booth (El Confesionario).** Tight, claustrophobic fish-eye lens close-up. The background is a simple, soundproofed wall. Select the character most likely to vent or gossip from the inputs. They are looking directly into the lens, highly emotional (crying or angrily gesturing), breaking the fourth wall.\n\n**[BOTTOM ROW]**\n* **[PANEL 3: Bottom-Left] Night Vision Secrets (Bedroom).** Monochrome green or grey infrared night-vision shot. Grainy, low fidelity. Total darkness in the room. Show two characters (strategic allies based on inputs) whispering conspiratorially in a bed, barely visible under covers.\n* **[PANEL 4: Bottom-Right] The Explosion (Garden/Smoking Area).** Chaotic, slightly shaky \"handheld camera\" feel, as if an operator ran to catch the action. High drama. A screaming argument at a party or nighttime gathering. The most volatile characters from the inputs are being physically separated by others. Flashing lights or dramatic shadows.\n\n**STYLE:** Raw reality TV broadcast screenshots, 2x2 grid, highly detailed, 4k",

His expression is determined, his eyes sharp, full of resolve, tightly gripping his Nichirin blade in its sheath. Half of his body has stepped onto the wooden bedroom floor, while the other half remains within the manga pages.\nThe giant manga book and interaction:\nA giant, thick Japanese edition of \"Demon Slayer\" manga book is spread open on a slightly worn wooden floor. Zenitsu breaks the boundary of the paper, and the pages are violently torn, curled, and burst where he steps out, with paper scraps and toner flying in the air.\n\nDetails within the manga page (picture-in-picture):\nThe pages display an extremely authentic black-and-white Japanese manga style.\nStyle: Rough black ink lines, rich screentone textures for shading, exaggerated speed lines.\n\nLayout: Strict Japanese right-to-left reading order, a surreal four-panel manga (yonkoma) spread.\nContent: Inside the broken panel, a trapped, manga-style Zenitsu can be seen. He is wearing the same clothes, shedding noodle tears in the panel, frantically knocking on the borders of the manga panel, accompanied by large Japanese onomatopoeia like \"出られない!\" (Can't get out!), \"えええ!?\", and \"ドンドンドン\" (Knocking sound). The manga version of him is watching the real-world version of himself tear the frame in terror.\n\nEnvironment and lighting:\nThe bedroom background is soft-focused, with domestic items like bed legs and bookshelves. Natural afternoon light streams in from the side window, illuminating the edges of the torn paper and the fabric texture of Zenitsu's clothes, emphasizing the strong contrast between reality and the two-dimensional world.",

She wears a crimson vinyl bomber jacket (high-gloss, ribbed cuffs), collar popped, catching the backlight like liquid fire. Beneath, a sleeveless mesh top reveals a dragon tattoo creeping up her forearm. \n\nCamera & Perspective: Extreme worm's-eye view shot from inside a drainage pipe (circular, 18-inch diameter), lens positioned 6 inches above the wet ground. Forced perspective distortion makes her hand a monumental, terrifying presence—fingers elongated, knuckles massive, veins bulging. The circular frame vignettes the image, creating a keyhole peep-show effect. \n\nAction & Composition: She leans forward aggressively, weight on her right leg, left knee bent, creating a dynamic diagonal thrust through the frame. Her right hand lunges toward camera, fingers splayed, index finger extended, casting a shadow that eclipses the dice. Her face is 3/4 obscured by the sunglasses and hair; only her pierced lower lip (silver hoop) and clenched jaw are visible, exuding predatory focus. \n\nSurface & Dice: The ground is rain-slicked asphalt with iridescent oil slicks (cyan, magenta, gold). 12 translucent red casino dice (precision-edged, pips glowing like embers) are scattered in chaotic abandon—some stacked, some mid-roll. Water beads cling to them, refracting light. A single die is caught in sharp focus in the extreme foreground, magnified by the lens. \n\nLighting & Atmosphere: Dense fog backlit by a single sodium-vapor streetlight (5700K, creating a hellish orange aura). Volumetric light rays pierce the fog, haloing her jacket. Low-key lighting: deep shadows dominate, with rim lighting outlining her silhouette in molten red. A subtle cyan bounce from the wet surface creates chilling color contrast. Lens flare: anamorphic horizontal streaks and circular bokeh orbs. \n\nTechnical Specs: Shot on ARRI Alexa 65, 12mm Laowa Probe Lens (f/2. 8, 1/1000s shutter), 8K resolution, ISO 6400 for grit. Deep focus from foreground die to her face. Cinematic aspect ratio: 2. 39:1 (though can be cropped to 4:5). Shot in Log-C, graded with Teal & Orange + Neon Noir LUT. \n\nPost-Processing: Chromatic aberration on high-contrast edges, film grain (Kodak 500T emulation), micro-contrast sharpening on rain droplets. Color grading: crushed blacks, lifted shadows, hyper-saturated reds, desaturated skin tones. Subtle vignette from the pipe's darkness. \n\nMood & Narrative: Neo-noir tension — a high-stakes underground gamb",

The main character of the image is \"{argument name=\"character\" default=\"an over-the-top chuunibyou knight\"}\", and the overall style should reference Persona 5 and street graffiti visuals, turning the character into an extremely flamboyant, extremely flat, ultra-cool anime figure.\n\nUse sharp cel-shading for the character, with hard, clean lines and crisp contours. The pose must be exaggerated and full of motion. You can use wide-angle or fisheye perspectives so that hands, weapons, or props appear extremely close to the camera, like a freeze-frame at the moment a special attack is unleashed. The expression should be highly dramatic, with confident, manic, or cold-blooded \"overacting\" intensity, rather than a calm everyday look.\n\nReject realistic volume and shading; instead, rely on large areas of pure black heavy shadows and highly saturated flat color blocks to create an extreme, high-contrast flat look. The main colors can be bright red, lemon yellow, electric blue, neon purple, etc., contrasted against large black shadow silhouettes. Add screentones, halftone dots, speed lines, and radiating lines in the shadows and background so the image feels like printed manga layered with street graffiti.\n\nThe background does not need realistic perspective space; it should be a flat visual collage stage filled with huge sans-serif English letters, torn paper effects, ink splatters, bold arrow graphics, speech bubbles, and onomatopoeia, such as exaggerated \"BOOM\", \"SLASH\", or \"WAKE UP\" graffiti sound effects. You can integrate UI elements into the scene—health bars, skill names, buttons, numbers, tooltips—floating around the main character, as if the game interface and the illustration have merged, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nKeep lighting high-contrast but not physically realistic; think in terms of graphic design areas of black/white/color rather than natural light logic. Edges between color areas on the character and background should be very sharp, without soft gradients; all colors should be clearly separated. You can add rough spray paint, smears, or hand-drawn graffiti textures in select areas to enhance the street and handmade feel.\n\nThe overall mood must be extremely dynamic, extremely chuunibyou, and extremely cool, as if the image is about to explode out of the screen, not quietly hang in a gallery. Avoid realistic oil painting styles, low-saturation vintage looks, or gentle, soft illustration styles. Do not use natural landscapes or everyday life backgrounds, and avoid soft, pastel color schemes. The image should be a vertical 2:3 high-resolution illustration, suitable as a tension-filled, maximalist pop-art manga poster.",
