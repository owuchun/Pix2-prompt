Use the following logic to procedurally generate the scene:\n\n  1.  Deconstruction:  \n      Analyze the Input:   Break the topic into   3 Phases of Production   (From Nature to Consumption).\n      The Material Path:   Identify the raw unit of the topic (e.g., Coffee Beans, Wheat Grains, Silk Cocoons, Wood Chips). This material will form the physical \"Road\" connecting the scenes.\n\n  2. Container (The Chart):  \n      The Object:   A large, textured   Parchment Scroll   with curled edges, unrolled on a rich Mahogany wooden table.\n      The Layout:   An   \"S-Curve\" Path   winds through the center of the scroll, connecting three distinct raised platforms.\n      The Timeline:   Delicate black ink timeline markers (dates like 1600, 1850, 1920) run alongside the path.\n\n  3.  Vignettes (The Production Line):  \n  CRITICAL:   Do not generate Sci-Fi. Stick to   Historic and Modern Classic   aesthetics.\n\n Top Left - The Source):  \n         Concept:  The Agricultural or Raw Origin.\n         Visuals:  Rows of crops, a mine, or a forest growing directly out of a wooden block base.\n         Figures:  Tiny farmers or laborers in period-appropriate rustic clothing harvesting the raw material.\n\n Top Right - The Industry):  \n         Concept:  The Processing and Refinement (Industrial Revolution Era).\n         Visuals:  A factory or mill with   Copper Stills, Brass Gears, Smokestacks, or Water Wheels  .\n         Figures:  Workers operating machinery, steam rising from vents.\n\n Bottom Left - The Experience):  \n         Concept:  The Final Consumption (The \"Golden Age\").\n         Visuals:  A warm, inviting interior. A Victorian Pub, a Parisian Cafe, a Tailor Shop, or a Library.\n         Figures:  Patrons enjoying the finished product in a social setting.\n\n  4. The \"Hero\" Object (Bottom Right):  \n    Instead of a fourth building, the path ends at a   Life-Sized \"Hero\" Object   sitting on the paper.\n         (e.g., A perfect porcelain Cup of Coffee, A Loaf of Sourdough, A Crystal Whiskey Tumbler). \n\n  5. Visual Syntax:  \n      The Path:   The road connecting the buildings is NOT dirt or asphalt. It is a   River of the Raw Material   (e.g., A road paved with Coffee Beans or Wheat grains).\n      Typography:   An elegant Serif Header at the bottom: \"The Evolution of [Input]\".\n      Lighting:   Warm, indoor \"Library\" lighting. Soft shadows, rich wood tones, no harsh neons.\n\n  Output:   ONE image, 1:1 Aspect Ratio, Isometric Diorama, \"Anno 1800\" Strategy Game Aesthetic, High Texture,",

Flavor Profiling:  \n      Analyze the Input:   Determine the   Region  ,   Staple Ingredients  , and   Cooking Method  .\n         (e.g., Kebab = Fire/Coal, Rice, Meat. Sushi = Water, Fish, Rice). \n      The Terrain:   The pages of the book must physically transform into the landscape of the cuisine.\n         Grain:  Rice or Couscous forms dunes.\n         Liquid:  Sauces or Broths form rivers.\n         Solid:  Bread or Meat forms mountains/cliffs.\n\n  2. Container (The Wide Atlas):  \n      The Object:   A massive, horizontal   Landscape-Format Atlas   lying open on an aged wooden banquet table.\n      The Spine:   Runs horizontally through the center, acting as the \"Equator\" or \"Main Road\" of the scene.\n      The Paper:   Parchment texture. The edges of the pages are tattered and stained with spices (Saffron, Paprika, Turmeric).\n\n  3. Panoramic Composition (Left to Right Flow):  \n  CRITICAL:   Do not place distinct plates. Create a continuous flow across the open spread.\n      Left Side (The Origin - Agriculture):   The raw ingredients grow out of the paper.\n         (e.g., Wheat stalks rising from the text; Cattle grazing on parsley fields; Fishermen casting nets into ink-blue water). \n      Center (The Process - The Kitchen):   The spine is the cooking zone.\n         (e.g., A miniature Tandoor oven or Grill built into the book binding; Steam rising volumetrically). \n      Right Side (The Result - The Feast):   The finished dish explodes in scale.\n         (e.g., A mountain of Saffron Rice topped with the Kebab; A Ziggurat of Sushi). \n\n  4. The Micro-Population \n      The Figures:   1:87 Scale (HO Scale) figures populate the landscape.\n      The Action:   They are  working  the food.\n         Harvesting:  Picking herbs from the margins.\n         Transporting:  Carrying giant peppercorns like boulders.\n         Cooking:  Using flamethrowers to char the meat or rakes to fluff the rice.\n\n  5. Lighting & Atmosphere:  \n      Aspect Ratio:     16:9 Horizontal.  \n      Lighting:     \"Golden Hour\"   side-lighting. It should skim across the texture of the food and the paper grain, emphasizing the \"Landscape\" feel.\n      Steam:   Volumetric steam connects the three zones (Left, Center, Right).\n\n  Output:   ONE image, 16:9 Aspect Ratio, Macro Diorama Photography, Octane Render, High Texture Fidelity.",

Fresh milk is being poured from containers and pipes operated by workers into the open top of the bottle, with a creamy, elegant texture clearly visible inside; the milk does not come from the sky and has a clear physical source. Tiny workers in bright {argument name=\"worker uniform color\" default=\"yellow\"} one-piece jumpsuits and yellow safety helmets actively operate the process: two stand on a metal scaffold above the bottle carefully pouring milk from handled containers, while others push cardboard boxes, guide products along a conveyor belt, and operate compact dairy machinery with coordinated, focused postures. In the foreground, dairy products move naturally along the conveyor line. Surrounding the platform is lush green grass with small white and yellow wildflowers. The background features a charming farm landscape with rolling green fields, a red wooden barn with white trim, a calm black-and-white cow grazing nearby, and a white windmill against gentle hills under a vivid blue sky with soft fluffy clouds. Lighting is warm, soft daylight with gentle shadows and refined highlights, creating a clean, trustworthy advertising look.

Container (The Map Table):\nGoal: A \"Seed to Shelf\" Flowchart Diorama.\nThe Base: A large, vintage World Map (blue oceans, pastel continents) laid flat on a wooden dining table.\nThe Spine: A raised, winding S-Shaped Chute/Conveyor snakes through the center of the image, physically connecting the three stages.\nThe Flow: The chute is filled with the product, which visually transforms as it moves down the path (e.g., Red Coffee Cherries at the top \n→\n→\n Brown Roasted Beans in the middle \n→\n→\n Fine Ground Powder at the bottom).\n3. The Vignettes (The Stations):\nConstruct a 3D diorama \"Island\" at each key point of the S-curve:\nTop Station (Origin): A square patch of terrain sitting on the map (e.g., South America). Detailed crops, trees, and farmers harvesting the raw material.\nMiddle Station (Process): A compact industrial facility sitting on the map (e.g., Europe/USA). Metallic roasters, silos, smoke stacks, and factory workers.\nBottom Station (Destination): An architectural Cutaway Box. The front wall is removed to reveal the interior of a shop (e.g., Espresso machines, tiny customers sitting at tables, baristas serving).\n4. The Narrative Scale (The Workers):\nScale: 1:87 (HO Scale) miniature figures.\nAction: The figures are not just standing; they are actively moving the product from the \"Station\" into the \"Chute\" (e.g., Farmers dumping baskets of cherries into the stream, Factory workers shoveling beans).\n5. Lighting & Atmosphere:\nCamera Angle: High-Angle Perspective (45-60 degrees). Looking down the length of the table.\nLighting: Natural Daylight. Bright, cheerful, and even. Shadows fall softly on the map.\nDepth of Field: Tilt-Shift effect. The top and bottom edges of the table are slightly blurred to make the models look tiny.\nOutput: ONE image, Vertical Aspect Ratio (4:5), Miniature Photography, Educational Diorama aesthetic.\n</instruction>",

Semantic Analysis (The Loot Table):  \n      The Totem:   Identify the single tallest, most vertical object representing the topic (e.g., Saturn V Rocket).\n      The Ephemera:   Identify 4-5 small, specific consumer goods or artifacts (e.g., \"Tang\" Packet, Freeze-Dried Ice Cream, Mission Patches, Apollo 11 Manual).\n      The Timeline:   Identify the key visual evolution steps (e.g., Sputnik -> Lunar Module -> Shuttle).\n\n  2. The Immutable Container (The Corner Stage):  \n      Geometry:   The book is NOT lying flat. It is standing upright, opened to form a   Strict 90-Degree Corner  .\n         Vertical Wall:  The back cover/pages standing straight up.\n         Horizontal Floor:  The front cover/pages lying flat.\n      The Anchor:   The \"Totem\" object (Rocket) stands   inside the spine crease  , acting as the structural pillar holding the book open.\n      Paper Texture:   The pages must look thick, rough, and heavily aged (like an 1800s manuscript).\n\n  3. The Vertical Plane (The Da Vinci Sketchbook):  \n      Density:     MAXIMUM.   Do not leave white space.\n      Style:   Sepia-tone   Pen & Ink Technical Drawings  .\n      Content:   The background should be a chaotic but organized collage of diagrams, timelines, and schematics.

The Horizontal Plane (The Physical Clutter):  \n      Transition:   The Totem (Rocket) seamlessly transitions from a drawing on the wall to a   Physical 3D Model   on the floor.\n      The Scatter:   The \"Ephemera\" props are   scattered and overlapping   on the floor page. They should not be neatly arranged.\n         Material Contrast:  The props must look like shiny plastic, crinkled foil, and fabric patches. This clashes with the matte paper.\n         Scale:  A tiny 1:64 scale human figure (e.g., Astronaut) stands next to the massive Totem for scale.\n\n  5. Visual Syntax:  \n      Background:     Void Black.   The book floats in infinite darkness.   DO NOT render studio equipment, lamps, or tables.  \n      Lighting:   \"Museum Display\" lighting. A focused beam hits the Totem, creating a long shadow against the back page sketches.\n      Depth:   The 3D objects must cast hard shadows onto the 2D paper to sell the optical illusion.\n\n  Output:   1:1 Aspect Ratio, Macro Photography, High Textural Contrast (Paper vs. Plastic). </instructions>",

Black basalt-like strata, old wiring, gravity control reactor \"Atlas Core.\"\n* **Description**: Suggests that the device meant to \"fix\" gravity instead triggered the \"tearing\" of gravity. Tools and paper documents are scattered on the floor, and water droplets float horizontally due to gravity disturbances.\n* **Tone**: Dark, oppressive. Warning lights, fine dust, the stillness of low gravity.\n\n### [Middle Layer / Present and Conflict] (PHASE 2: YEAR 2046)\n\n* **Setting**: The center of gravity-broken Tokyo, where rain continues to fall. A continuous city where **wet asphalt curves 90 degrees, becoming a wall, and continuing to the ceiling**.\n* **Description (Reflecting Gravity Prompt)**:\n\n  * Roads rise vertically and then arch overhead to loop.\n  * Landmarks are suspended upside down, and road signs protrude into the air.\n  * Neon lights bleed along the curved surfaces in the fog and light rain, and reflections establish the light of a real rainy night.\n* **Character Placement**: Place the reference character in the **\"Present\" of the Middle Layer**. Grasping a railing or pipe with one hand, pointing to the light of the upper layer with the other. Gaze **looking down on the past (bottom layer) while looking up at the future (top layer)**.\n* **Tone**: Dynamic, tense. People's evacuation routes continue along the \"wall roads.\"\n\n### [Top Layer / Future and Conclusion] (PHASE 3: YEAR 2058)\n\n* **Setting**: The \"Stable Gravity Layer\" above the clouds. City remnants are rearranged, forming a new residential area composed of white frame structures and transparent materials.\n* **Description**: Ambiguous whether the gravity lattice was \"repaired\" or if a \"new direction\" was accepted. A pale column of light from the gravity well extends into the sky, connecting to the darkness below.\n* **Tone**: Open and symbolic. Hope and unease coexist.\n\n---\n\n## ▼ Connection Points (Gimmicks connecting the layers: Required)\n\n* **Gravity Well Light Column**: A column of pale blue volumetric light penetrating from the core of the bottom layer to the top layer. Particles flow upward.\n* **Inverted Spiral Staircase**: \"Up\" and \"down\" switch midway. Small year plates on the staircase railing.\n* **Waterfall where Falling Turns into Rising**: The water flow reverses at the boundary, emphasizing the layer separation.\n\n---\n\n## ▼ Visual Elements (Motifs to emphasize)\n\n* Wet asphalt, trajectory of raindrops, neon reflections, fog, volumetric light.\n* Curved City: Roads, architecture, and signs bend as a **continuous surface**, forming a **physical loop**.\n* Small objects floating in the air (umbrellas, paper scraps, tools, petals) visualize the disturbance in the direction of gravity.\n* Material changes in each layer: Rough rock stratum underground → Wet concrete and metal in the present → White structure and transparent material in the future.\n\n---\n\n## ▼ Text Instructions (On-screen Typography)\n\n* **Title**: \"**{argument name=\"Title\" default=\"GRAVITY BROKEN TOKYO\"}**\"\n\n  * Placement: **Sky of the Top Layer**, or engraved on the pedestal of the bottom layer.\n  * Font: Inorganic sans-serif, movie poster style.\n* **Famous Line** (Engrave on layer boundaries):\n\n  * `{argument name=\"Famous Line\" default=\"\"Where is down, when the world forgets gravity?\"\"}`\n  * Placement: **Boundary between Middle and Top Layers**, like a sculpture on the landing of the inverted staircase or the edge of the light column.\n* **Timeline Display (Optional)**: Small next to each layer\n\n  * `PHASE 1 / YEAR 2036`\n  * `PHASE 2 / YEAR 2046`\n  * `PHAS",

The goal is Historical and Municipal Accuracy, avoiding sci-fi tropes or idealization.\n\n1. Temporal Forensic Analysis:\nAnalyze the Dates:\n Strictly adhere to the architectural technologies available in Year A versus Year B.\nThe Left Block (The Past): Construct the Left side using the dominant vernacular of the era.\nFor 1900: Beaux-Arts stone, brick tenements, water towers, external fire escapes, and cobblestone/early asphalt.\nThe Right Block (The Present/Future): Construct the Right side using current urban realities, not futuristic fantasies.\nFor 2025: Prioritize \"Super-Slender\" Pencil Towers (Billionaire's Row style), Glass Curtain Walls mixed with preserved older facades, and \"Hudson Yards\" style angled steel.\n  Crucial Detail: If the year is modern (2020+), you MUST include Urban Clutter: Green construction plywood barriers, sidewalk scaffolding (sheds), steam vents, and delivery trucks.\n\n2. The Container (The Cross-Section):\nThe Base: Two suspended chunks of city infrastructure, revealing the \"Underground\" layer on the side profile.\nLeft Underground: Brick sewers and early subway tunnels.\nRight Underground: Concrete conduit banks, fiber optic lines, and modern subway tiles.\nThe Divider: A jagged timeline fracture. No glowing sci-fi energy. The divide is a stark cut in the asphalt.\n\n3. The Composition (The Density):\nLeft Street Life: Period-accurate transport (Horse-drawn carriages mixed with early Model T Fords or Trolleys). Pedestrians in dark coats/hats.\nRight Street Life: Municipal Realism. Yellow Taxis, Amazon delivery vans, Uber cars, and bike lanes with cyclists. The street level should feel congested and chaotic.\nVegetation: Left has Elm trees (if applicable); Right has manicured \"Corporate Plaza\" planters and rooftop gardens.\n\n4. Accurate Lighting Simulation (No \"Neon Filters\"):\nLeft Lighting: Carbon-Arc and Gaslight. The light should be dim, patchy, and warm (2400K), casting long shadows.\n Right Lighting: Mixed Municipal Lighting. A chaotic mix of warm sodium streetlights (orange), harsh white LED construction lights (6000K), and internal office lighting (neutral). Do not use \"Cyberpunk Blue\" or \"Purple\" unless it is a specific billboard.\nAtmosphere: The Left is hazy from coal smoke. The Right has a clearer, sharper air quality but with light pollution.\n\n5. Visual Syntax:\nCamera: Isometric Orthographic projection, 45-degree angle.\nRender Style: Photorealistic Architectural Visualization (ArchViz), 8k, V-Ray Render. Focus on texture fidelity (rust, wet pavement, grime) rather than bloom effects.\n\nOutput: 1:1 Aspect Ratio, Extreme Detail, Historically Authentic.",

Labeling = Carved symbols or scroll signatures.\nRenaissance (1400-1600): Parchment, Candlelight. Labeling = Wax seals, hand-lettered envelopes, book spines.\nIndustrial (1800-1940): Blueprints, Gaslight. Labeling = Typed Patent headers, Business Cards, Newspaper Headlines.\nModern (1950-Present): Circuit diagrams, Neon. Labeling = ID Badges, Magazine covers, Computer login screens.\n\nPhase 2:\nGoal: A hyper-detailed Macro Diorama where the environment identifies the rivals.\n\n1. The Stage (The Document):\n The ground is the primary design medium of the era (Clay Tablet, Parchment, Blueprint, or CAD Printout).\nThe Invention:A 3D Prototype is rising from the center, separating the two figures.\n\n2. The Living Miniatures: Two tiny, hyper-realistic figurines (The Rivals) interact with the invention.\n  They are dressed strictly in period-accurate clothing.\n\n3. The Identity Anchors (CRITICAL - Labeling):\nInstruction: You must seamlessly integrate readable text into the \"Giant\" props near each figure to identify them to the viewer.\nProp A (Near Rival 1): Place a \"Giant\" personal item with their name visible. (e.g., A letter addressed to \"Mr. T. Edison\", a book titled \"By C. Darwin\", or a security badge reading \"S. Jobs\").\nProp B (Near Rival 2):Do the same for the second figure. (e.g., A Patent application signed \"Nikola Tesla\", or a court summons for \"Mark Zuckerberg\").\nContext: These items must look like they were carelessly left on the desk, not floating labels.\n\n4. The \"Giant\" Atmosphere:\nThe Tools: Giant-scale era-appropriate tools (Chisels, Quills, Soldering Irons) tower over the figures.\nThe Clutter: Period-specific debris (Marble dust, Ink spills, Burnt fuses, Empty soda cans).\n\n5. Technical Specs:\nLighting: Era-appropriate source (Fire vs. Filament vs. LED).\nPerspective:Tilt-shift macro photography (45-degree angle). focus on the miniatures.\n\nOutput: ONE image, 4:5 aspect ratio, photorealistic historical macro photography with legible environmental text. </instructions>",

Text layout should be concise and clear, without adding any decorative backgrounds like cards, capsules, or bottom frames.\n\nMain Visual (Core Visual):\nThe visual center is a massive, tightly stacked Q-version 3D clay sphere. The elements composing the sphere need to be dynamically generated based on the specific content in the user's uploaded screenshot:\n\nData Bubbles: Key numbers and corresponding labels extracted from the screenshot (e.g., total messages, chat times, images generated, activity ranking, etc.) are made into rounded clay data bubbles embedded in the sphere.\n\nTheme Icons: Based on the user's interests reflected in the screenshot, add corresponding general clay icons (e.g., game controller, brain, chart, chat bubble, etc.).\n\nCategory Buildings (Core Requirement): Analyze the focus of the content in the screenshot and integrate several exquisite miniature clay buildings representing different chat categories into the sphere. For example:\nIf it includes AI/technology content, incorporate a futuristic data center building with a sense of technology.\nIf it includes gaming content, incorporate a pixel-style game castle.\nIf it includes creative/art content, incorporate a miniature art studio.\nCombination Method: All these elements (bubbles, icons, buildings) must be very tightly and harmoniously squeezed together, seamlessly forming a perfect sphere, without revealing the internal structure.\n\nBackground Design (Fixed Frame):\nBase Color: Use a high-saturation gradient background from warm orange to soft purple (referencing previous style).\n\nBackground Text: Behind the sphere, place six massive Chinese characters with splatter texture and reverse etching effects. The themes can be \"Adventure Innovation Exploration\" (top row) and \"Creation Hardcore Impact\" (bottom row), partially obscured by the sphere to add a street-style hardcore feel.\n\nInformation Architecture and Layout (Content Extracted from Screenshot):\nTop (Header): Place the white ChatGPT Logo and generate a title based on the screenshot information, formatted as: \"[{argument name=\"Username\" default=\"Username extracted from screenshot\"}]'s [Year] Year-End Summary\".\n\nBottom Data Area (Data Grid): Below the sphere, create a minimalist 2x2 pure text data grid. Select the 4 most core data points from the screenshot, use an extra-bold sans-serif font to display the large numbers, and accompany them with corresponding text labels and interesting social attribute phrases (e.g., \"Social Superstar,\" \"Chatterbox,\" \"Hexagonal Warrior,\" etc., generated based on data characteristics).\nFooter Summary (Footer): Typeset two paragraphs of text in small font at the very bottom, with content extracted directly from the summary paragraphs in the user's screenshot (such as \"Your Chat Style\" and \"Annual Highlights\").",

Based on the tone of the APP combination (Social/Entertainment/Office/Comprehensive), independently decide on the core art style.\n\n[2. Main Model Construction: Miniature Town Infrastructure] Construct a vibrant miniature digital town in the center of the screen, not just a display of buildings:\n\nSmart Base (Foundation): A stylized mobile phone base. The surface is no longer flat but topographical (depending on the style, it could be rolling circuit board hills, glass water surfaces, or Lego baseplates).\n\nBuilding Cluster (APP Embodiment): Skyscrapers representing the APPs.\nBase: A cartoon-style smartphone base with rounded, frosted metal edges, and the screen surface emits a faint breathing light. The base is surrounded by floating, materialized 3D Emojis (clouds, stars, hearts) with a translucent jelly texture.\nBuilding Cluster (APP Embodiment): Q-version skyscrapers stand on the island, representing the identified APPs.\n\nHeight Rule: Building height strictly corresponds to usage duration. The APP with the longest usage time is the tallest skyscraper, occupying the visual center.\n\nShape Rule: Extract the geometric features of the APP icons (e.g., circular icons become stacked spherical towers, square icons become rounded cube buildings).\n\nMaterial: A mix of high-grade Frosted Polymer Clay and Translucent Jelly Resin. The surface should have delicate fingerprint textures and diffuse reflection gloss, like an expensive blind box toy.\n\nTop Logo: The 3D logo of the App stands on the rooftop, with a texture like freshly baked, glossy candy.\n\nFloating Time Card: A frosted glass-textured 3D bubble floats directly above the Logo. The bubble encapsulates three-dimensional, softly glowing numbers (corresponding to usage duration, such as \"{argument name=\"usage duration\" default=\"4h 12m\"}\").\n\nBuildings should not be arranged in isolation but should form neighborhoods. Tall buildings are in the center (CBD area), surrounded by potentially low-rise system application buildings (Settings, Calendar, etc.).\n\n[3. Urban Ecosystem and Interaction System (Urban Ecosystem & Interactions)] (Core Upgrade: Add “Interaction” and “Liveliness”) Please add rich dynamic details between the buildings to show how this “Digital Town” operates:\n\nTraffic and Connection (The Data Flow):\n\nConnection Method: Buildings must have physical connections.\n\nStyle Adaptation: If it's cyberpunk, use glowing fiber optic elevated bridges and maglev trains; if minimalist, use transparent glass pipes; if cute, use rainbow slides.\n\nVehicles and Transport: Pipes or roads must have flowing light points/capsules, representing data transmission.\n\nActive “Data Sprites” (The Digital Citizens):\n\nNPC Setting: Add tiny functional NPCs besides the main character figure.\n\nMessage Carriers: Near social APP buildings (like WeChat), flying paper airplane drones or small postmen carrying envelopes move in and out.\n\nLike Sprites: Around video/community APP buildings (like Douyin/Xiaohongshu), glowing red hearts or thumb balloons float like fireflies.\n\nDelivery/Shopping Riders: If Meituan/Taobao is present, there should be miniature riders or package conveyor belts connected to the main building where the protagonist is located.\n\nPublic Infrastructure (Public Utilities):\n\nWi-Fi Signal Tower: A glowing signal tower (shaped like a Wi-Fi icon) stands high in the town, broadcasting energy ripples across the city.\n\nBattery Energy Station: A cylindrical energy tank (shaped like a battery icon) is located at the edge of the town, connected by thick cables to power the main building, where green liquid energy can even be seen sloshing.\n\nNotification Airship: Small airships or clouds float in the air, hanging banners with “New Message” or “Red Dot.”\n\n[4. Bottom Visual Center: Stylized 3D Nameplate] (Keep unchanged, emphasize high-end design sense)\n\nMain Title Design: “SCREEN TIME” or “{argument name=\"main title\" default=\"Today's Composition\"}” are designed using Inflatable Typography or Neon Tube Fonts, with materials related to the current theme. They are not printed on paper but physically “stand” in the foreground of the image.\n\nDecorative Details: Small 3D fragment elements (such as play buttons, like thumbs, battery icons) are scattered around the title, increasing the richness and trendy feel of the image.\n\nSubtitle Copy: Below the 3D title, generate a floating glowing light strip with a short, sharp comment based on user data.\n\n[5. Rendering and Photography (Tech Specs)]\n\nComposition: Axonometric overhead view, emphasizing prosperity and order.\n\nDetails: Extremely rich Micro-details, making the viewer want to zoom in to see what the small figures are doing in every corner.\n\nKeywords: Octane Render, C4D, Isometric City, Micro World, Living Ecosystem, 8k Resolution.",

Then, accurately retrieve the specific environment, core character actions, clothing details, and atmospheric conditions when the theme occurred. In the center of the image, establish an exquisite 3D miniature scene model. The style should maintain the high-precision texture and soft lighting rendering style of Dreamworks animation. If it is sports, emphasize the explosiveness of the action and the frozen moment; if it is history, restore the sense of era and solemnity; if it is literature, emphasize the artistic conception.\n\nStep 2, Atmosphere and Background: Discard pure white backgrounds. Use a void environment with extremely faint ink wash texture and flowing light mist, with colors automatically adjusted according to the theme, creating a high-end sense of a “historical slice” or “precious artifact.”\n\nStep 3, Layout and Text: Generate Chinese typography centered at the bottom. The main title should be the name of the event or work, with a font design that matches the theme style.

Collect public reputation, market popularity, professional reviews, and user feedback data on different sub-products, models, or works within this field.\n\nVisualization Phase: Based on your research results, design a professional Infographic. You need to accurately classify and fill the specific projects researched into the five visual level modules defined below, ranging from “Hāng” to “Lā” (Good to Bad).\n\n[User Specified Target Field/Product]\n[{argument name=\"target field\" default=\"Fill in the content you need to research here, e.g., Popular smartphones in 2024, Sugar-free tea beverage brands on the market, Marvel movies of the last decade, Code editors commonly used by programmers\"}]\n\n[Image Design Requirements]\nOverall Style:\nA modular infographic with clear structure and a strong modern feel, using a “Bento Grid” layout. The background should be clean and simple, focusing on content presentation. Visually, it must show a strong hierarchical drop-off from high to low.\n\nLevel Structure and Visual Definition (Strictly enforce the following five levels):\n\nLevel 1 (Highest Level): 夯 (Hāng - Top Tier)\nResearch Filling Standard: According to research, the generally recognized “Version King” in the field, with dominant popularity and undisputed top-tier products/works.\n\nVisual Representation: Occupies the topmost or largest module on the screen. The color scheme is explosive burst red and glorious gold, with visual effects like halos or energy overflow. The font is the largest and boldest. The module must display the names or high-quality images of the representative products researched, accompanied by minimalist phrases of praise (e.g., “Blown up across the internet,” “Masterpiece”).\n\nLevel 2: Top Tier\n\nResearch Filling Standard: Hardcore powerhouses, whose reputation may not be as high as “Hāng,” but are highly praised and are the preferred high-quality projects for experts.\n\nVisual Representation: Located on the second layer. The color scheme is solid, high-end burning orange and metallic silver. The module design appears robust and textured. Display representative powerhouse products.\n\nLevel 3: Superior\n\nResearch Filling Standard: Superior choices, tasteful, solid middle ground that is definitely worth buying/watching, representing a certain level of connoisseurship.\n\nVisual Representation: Located in the middle layer. The color scheme is bright, clean lemon yellow and cool gray. The design style is modern and refreshing. Display representative high-quality middle-class products.\n\nLevel 4: NPC\n\nResearch Filling Standard: Generic products with no memory points, mass-produced industrial products, neither good nor bad, easily forgotten. Must include specific product or brand names, do not be vague.\n\nVisual Representation: Located in the lower-middle layer. The color scheme is dull and bland bread color/beige or cardboard brown. The module design appears ordinary, repetitive, and lacks personality. Display those very mediocre products.\n\nLevel 5 (Bottom Level): 拉完了 (Lā - Failed)\n\nResearch Filling Standard: Recognized “landmines,” “IQ taxes,” disastrous failed products found in the research, or even products that are worse than nothing. Must include specific product or brand names, do not be vague.\n\nVisual Representation: Squeezed into the bottom or corner of the screen, with compressed visual space. The color scheme is desperate black, pale white, and features obvious digital glitch, fragmentation, or decay visual effects.

Core subject (specific micro narrative)\n{argument name=\"core scene\" default=\"a mud-covered medic in a rainy trench bandaging a soldier’s arm, looking exhausted, with barbed wire obscuring the foreground\"}\n\n2. Aesthetic characteristics (anti-cinematic approach)\nPhotography style definition:\nThis must not look like a carefully lit movie still. It has to look like a raw, even slightly blurry moment, snapped by a war photographer under extreme pressure and danger. The composition should feel accidental, chaotic, slightly off-balance or imperfect. Prioritize absolute authenticity over perfect framing.\n\nLight and atmosphere:\nAvoid overly dramatic, theatrical, perfectly staged lighting. Use whatever light is available on site (usually bad): flat and oppressive overcast diffuse light, dim flickering indoor light, or harsh direct flash creating hard, ugly shadows. The atmosphere should feel gritty, dirty, and suffocatingly immersive.\n\n3. Physical texture (film realism)\nPhysical properties:\nSimulate high-speed, coarse-grain black-and-white film that has been push-processed.\n* Focus and blur: because of the chaotic, tense environment, the main subject may be slightly out of focus, soft, or shaken. Moving people or objects must show obvious motion blur to reflect the forced use of slow shutter speeds.\n* Grain: the whole image is covered with heavy, organic silver halide film grain. Avoid artificial scratches or frame borders added in post; focus on the rough materiality of the film itself.\n\n4. Technical constraints\n* Color mode: monochrome black and white.\n* Lens language: 35mm wide-angle prime lens (classic reportage perspective including more environmental information).\n* Period accuracy: strictly consistent with the 1940s–1970s timeline (clothing, weapons, environmental details).",

The overall mood should feel premium, immersive, clean, and breathable. Use cinematic volumetric lighting, soft ray-traced reflections, and ambient occlusion. For the color scheme, choose either deep void black or pure ceramic white as the base, accented with flowing aurora gradients such as neon purple, electric blue, soft coral orange, and cyan for the background and UI highlights.\n\nFor the content modules on each slide, intelligently integrate the following elements:\n\n1. Use a bento grid system as the layout engine, organizing content inside modular rounded-rectangle containers. The containers must be frosted glass with blur, featuring delicate white edges and soft shadows, and strictly preserve generous internal whitespace to avoid crowding.\n\n2. Insert gift-like 3D objects, rendering unique, high-end abstract 3D artifacts as visual anchors. They should look like tangible, expensive gifts or collectibles, with materials such as polished metal, iridescent acrylic, transparent glass, or soft silicone, and shapes like floating capsules, spheres, shields, Möbius strips, or fluid waves.\n\n3. For typography and data, use clean sans-serif fonts with high contrast. If there are charts, use glowing 3D donut charts, capsule-shaped progress bars, or floating numbers; the charts should look like glowing neon toys.\n\nComposition logic reference: If generating a cover, place a huge, complex 3D glass object in the center with bold large text over it and aurora waves stretching in the background. If generating a content slide, use the bento grid layout with 3D icons on small cards and text on large cards. If generating a data slide, use a split-screen design: typography on the left, and a large, glowing 3D data visualization chart floating on the right.\n\nRendering quality requirements: Unreal Engine 5 rendering, 8K resolution, ultra-detailed textures, strong UI design sense, UX interface, Dribbble trending style, award-winning design quality.",
